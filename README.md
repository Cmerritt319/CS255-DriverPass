# CS255-DriverPass
CS255 Systems Analysis project, DriverPass. Part one is the business requirement document and part two is the system design document. Also Attached is my presentation.

This project, DriverPass, was a project that aimed to provide services to those whom where failing their driving tests. They wanted us to design a system that: 

1. Helped individuals pass their driving tests.
2. Provided a tiered package system to cater to students needs. The first of the three packages offering six hours in a car with an instructor, second of the three packages offering eight hours in a car with an instructor and an in-person lesson, and the third of three packages offering 12 hours in a car with an instructor, an in-person lesson, and access to online course material in addition to practice tests.
3. Provided a scheduling service to pair students up with instructors and assign them a car.
4. Provided a way to give feedback to students.
5. Did it all from a desktop or phone.

The things that felt the most proud of during this was the presentation. As it sits, I have a casual tone. I have experience breaking down complicated concepts into easy or easier to understand terms and I think my presentation shows that. I also felt I did a good job doing my UML Use Case Diagrams, after initially feeling that I had done them incorrectly: listing out Databases as secondary actors while putting all other users as primary users. After these initial thoughts and reflecting on what others did, I feel like I had it right. I just needed to make some minor adjustments to help whomever was looking at the UML Use case diagram understand what was going on.

The thing I did the worst on was my overall professional tone within the business requirement worksheet. As I stated before, I have a casual tone. This document was not supposed to be a casual tone what-so-ever. So needless to say, if I were to revise any portion of this project, I would revise this document to use more concise and professional vocabulary when talking about requirements and system functions while being more vague when talking about who wanted what, instead more focusing on either which role wanted what or not listing who wanted what at all. 

I ended up interpreting the users needs by grouping the different things that were said about particular areas throughout the transcript, and then running with it. Its important to include the users needs because you are making the system for them: you are there to help them pain their picture because they cant do it themselves. There were some areas that weren't mentioned within the interview that were included in the business requirements sheet, namely security features which were derived from self and prompts.

I will likely use the same method for software design in the future: grouping different things that the client wants together and then running with it. If I were to do anything differently it would be to: try to leave no detail unturned and be actively engaged with the client when required. One thing that I did find difficult with this project was there was no active dialogue to gain clarification on different questions that I had on the project as a whole. As someone with prior project management experience, I am used to being able to talk with the client to hammer out details on what they want out the product I am developing. I could not do that here.
